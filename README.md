# Datathon2025_Machine Learning Model_Health

## Data
The data this repo depends on are too large (>100MB) to upload here so it is stored in this repo [Datathon2025_Data](https://github.com/JoeyDing2003/Datathon2025_Data) via git lfs

 ## Functional coding files
 This repo includes 2 coding files for tasks:
 - `Data_Cleaning.ipynb`: conduct EDA and data cleaning on `Raw_Data.csv` and then generate `Refined_Data.csv`, which are all stored in [Datathon2025_Data](https://github.com/JoeyDing2003/Datathon2025_Data)
 - `ML_Modeling.ipynb`: use `Refined_Data.csv` as Training/Testing dataset to build and evaluate machine learning models.
 
## Conda Environment config
`Data-ML.yml` is the description of conda environment where .ipynb files are locally run
